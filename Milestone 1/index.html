          Chicken 65 is a traditional Indiad deep-fried chicken dish known for it's spice. This dish is made of marinated chicken, coated with with flour, then fried along with curry leaves and spices. The staple flavors of the dish come from the garlic and red chillies. This one came into my head as I was feeling homesick during my math lecture. :)

          Strawberry milk is an immensely popular drink which I just so happen to be craving at the moment. This particular recipe involves dicing strawberries, mashing them. then boiling them down with some sugar into a syrup like consistency. Then this syrup is mixed with milk and can be served.

          Spam Musubi is a popular snack or lunch food consisting of a slice of grilled spam ontop of rice and wrapped in a seaweed wrapper. This dish is unique to Hawaiin culture and draws some influence Japenese food. I thought of this one just now as I was making this site.
